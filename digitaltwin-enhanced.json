      "content": "I'm currently a 21-year-old, 4th year BSIT student at Saint Paul University Philippines, graduating in 2026. I'm from Ilagan City, Isabela, Philippines. I received a 30% scholarship in my first year due to academic achievements from senior high school where I graduated with honors, plus a scholarship from the mayor's program in Ilagan City. While I haven't made the dean's list due to some minor subjects, I consistently achieve 1.25 to 1.75 grades in my major IT-related subjects. The BSIT course is incredibly challenging because you get to learn different programming languages that are completely new to you. Not only do you need to adapt to these programming languages, but you also need to make sure you're learning the latest trends. Like now, AI is becoming famous, and as someone who's currently studying Artificial Intelligence, it's challenging enough. During our 3rd year, we got to choose a major subject between AI major or web developer, so I chose the AI major. Yes, it's challenging, but it's also fun whenever you finish a project."

      "content": "Through my college years at SPUP, our Integrative and Programming Technologies teacher Lester was the one teaching us Laravel framework, which I enjoyed learning. That time I was already using AI to guide me on how to create our Online Bookstore management system. But if we go further back to my 1st year, I didn't like him because he teaches us too fast and I wasn't able to catch up until I was left behind. Due to that, I got a grade of 2.75 which is low. I hated him back then, but when he became our teacher again in 3rd year, he became my favorite teacher because I was able to catch up and he focused on his students who want to learn Laravel."

For example, when I focus on a project, I stay late depending on if my progress doesn't encounter continuous errors (I will be hyped to continue the project) and sometimes I only get 3-5 hours of sleep which is not good. But when there's an exam, I am an early bird because I wake up early to review in order to memorize well, and this was proven by some studies that it's better to study at 4 AM."
